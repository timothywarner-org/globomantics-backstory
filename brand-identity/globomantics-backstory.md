## Company Overview
Globomantics Robotics is a global leader in advanced robotics and automation solutions, founded in 2015 with the mission of "Maniacally Taking Tech to the Globe." What started as a small team of robotics engineers in a Silicon Valley garage has grown into a multinational corporation with offices in 42 countries and over 15,000 employees worldwide.

## Origin Story
Founded by Dr. Sarah Chen (MIT Robotics PhD) and Marcus Rodriguez (former NASA engineer), Globomantics began when they recognized a critical gap in the robotics industry: most solutions were either too complex for everyday businesses or too simple to make a real impact. Their breakthrough came with the development of the Adaptive Intelligence Framework (AIF), which allows robots to learn and adapt to new environments without extensive reprogramming.
