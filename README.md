# Globomantics Backstory

Welcome, Pluralsight authors! ðŸ‘‹

This repo is your one-stop shop for reusable course assets themed around the fictional **Globomantics Robotics** company.  
It's designed to help you quickly add realistic context, visuals, and data to your own coursesâ€”no need to invent a fake company from scratch!

## What's Inside?

- **Modular Assets:**  
  Each top-level folder (e.g., `account-log-in/`, `account-sign-up/`, `datasets/`) contains images, mock data, and code snippets for a specific course scenario or feature.

- **Images & Icons:**  
  Pre-made SVGs and PNGs for UI mockups, dashboards, and more.

- **Sample Data:**  
  Realistic CSVs and datasets for demos, exercises, and hands-on labs.

- **Branding:**  
  Logos, color palettes, and fonts to keep your course visuals consistent.

## How Do I Use This?

1. **Browse the folders** for a scenario or asset you need (e.g., login screens, HR datasets, marketing visuals).
2. **Copy or reference** the files directly in your own course repo.
3. **Remix or extend**â€”feel free to add your own assets and submit a PR for others to use!
