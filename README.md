## What's Inside?

- **Modular Assets:**

- **Images & Icons:**  
  Pre-made SVGs and PNGs for UI mockups, dashboards, and more.

- **Sample Data:**  
  Realistic CSVs and datasets for demos, exercises, and hands-on labs.

- **Branding:**  
  Logos, color palettes, and fonts to keep your course visuals consistent.

2. **Copy the relevant files or folders** directly into your own course repo or project.
3. **Update references** in your code or Markdown to point to the new local paths.
4. **Remix or extend**—feel free to adapt assets and submit a PR to share improvements!

*Tip: Each solution is designed to be as self-contained as possible for easy pluggability.*
